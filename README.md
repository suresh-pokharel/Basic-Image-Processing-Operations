# Basic-Image-Processing-Operations
Data Augmentation using affine transformation, image statistics, Binarization, Histogram Equalization, Image Inpainting


### 1. Download PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset available at this link: http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/. (50 points)
- On a subset of 50 images from PASCAL VOC dataset, perform data augmentation by applying affine transformation to the images (translation, rotation, scaling etc..)
- On a randomly selected image from PASCAL VOC dataset compute (a) image statistics, (b) histogram, (c) histogram equalization and (d) binarize it.
### 2. Apply inpainting operation based on the algorithm Fast Marching to remove glare from the below image. The corresponding mask is also given.
